Must have for 8.0.0.GA:
 + Whiteboard preprocessors
 - RegEx filter mapping
 - org.osgi.framework.ServiceObjects and proper service management (unget, prototype, singleton, bundle scopes)
 - DTOs
 + "listener=true" for Whiteboard listeners
 - Listener ordering according to ranking
 + Whiteboard WebSockets
 - CRLs
 - Session per OsgiContextModel / OsgiServletContext
 - Mixing (in different order) WAB and Whiteboard contexts
 - JSP servlet configuration through Pax Web PID
 - Allocating contexts for WABs, where WAB's OsgiContextModel is of highest priority (can't have other OsgiContextModel overring the WAB's one)
 - Karaf integration tests

Moved to after 8.0.0.GA (8.0.x):
 - JAX-RS example with aries-jaxrs
 - Jetty/Tomcat/Undertow bundles
 - HTTP context processing (potentially with external web-fragment.xml)
 - HTTP/2 (mostly tests)
 - Keycloak integration
 - Jasypt encryption in PID
 - @ServletSecurity, @RunAs, @DeclareRoles annotations on servlets
 - skipping configured web fragments (no scanning, as in Tomcat's tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanFilter.jarsToSkip)

Move to 8.1.x:
 - Jetty org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler and org.eclipse.jetty.server.Connector tracking
 - Web-VirtualHosts / Web-Connectors
 - Switch away from JAXB to SAX/StAX parsing for undertow.xml
